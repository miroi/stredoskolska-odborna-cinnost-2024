Its dipole moment is 1.08 D,[6] in contrast with naphthalene, which has a dipole moment of zero. 
This polarity can be explained by regarding azulene as the fusion of a 6 π-electron cyclopentadienyl anion and a 6 π-electron tropylium cation: 
one electron from the seven-membered ring is transferred to the five-membered ring to give each ring aromatic stability by Hückel's rule.
 Reactivity studies confirm that seven-membered ring is electrophilic and the five-membered ring is nucleophilic.

dipole(PM7)= 1.695 D
