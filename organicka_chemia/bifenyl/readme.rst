Bifenyl

"In the case of unsubstituted biphenyl, the equilibrium torsional angle is 44.4° and the torsional barriers are quite small, 6.0 kJ/mol at 0° 
and 6.5 kJ/mol at 90°.[14] 
Adding ortho substituents greatly increases the barrier: 
in the case of the 2,2'-dimethyl derivative, the barrier is 17.4 kcal/mol (72.8 kJ/mol).[15]"
