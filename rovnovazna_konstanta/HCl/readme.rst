HCl Gibbsova volna energia
===========================

http://openmopac.net/manual/gibbs.html

The heat of formation, ΔHf, of an element in its standard state (298K, 1 atmosphere pressure) is zero.
The free energy of formation, ΔFf, of an element in its standard state is zero.

H2 + Cl2 -> 2HCl
 
HCl: PM7
    exp Hf, S :  https://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?ID=C7647010&Units=SI&Mask=1#Thermo-Gas 
    Hf =  -20.486 kcal/mol (exp. -22.06 kcal/mol)
    S(298)=44.5995 CAL/K/MOL (exp. 44.640317 CAL/K/MOL)
